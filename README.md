The smallest, fastest, fully-conformant Kubernetes that tracks upstream releases and makes clustering trivial. MicroK8s is great for offline development, prototyping, and testing. Use it on a VM as a small, cheap, reliable k8s for CI/CD. The best Kubernetes for appliances. Develop IoT apps for k8s and deploy them to MicroK8s on your Linux boxes.
